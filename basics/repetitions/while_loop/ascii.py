# The program should start by displaying the message "How many bars should be charged?".
# The program should then read in the user's response.
# The program should then create a variable to track the number of bars charged and set this to 0.
# The program should then use a while loop to do the following:
#    Display the message "Charging:".
#    Increment the variable for tracking the number of charged bars.
#    Display the number of charged bars.
# Finally, the program should display the message "The battery is fully charged."
